MIJS - Minimal Irreducible JavaScript
=====================================

[https://github.com/rsp/node-mijs](https://github.com/rsp/node-mijs)
([readme](https://github.com/rsp/node-mijs#readme))

This is a try to find a minimal, irreducible set of JavaScript features
that can be used to write useful programs.

This is not an attempt to produce anything even remotely practical.
If any feature of the language can be avoided ad reimplemented using a smaller
set of features making programs run million times slower, it will be.

The module will be published on npm as [`mijs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mijs)
so anyone could easily try the examples.
When the module is finished, an article about it will be published on Medium
at [https://medium.com/@pocztarski](https://medium.com/@pocztarski).
Stay tuned.

This module adds functions to the global scope to simplify examples.
